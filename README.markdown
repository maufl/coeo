# Coeo - augment your social life

Coeo aims to support your social life by helping you to keep in touch with friends,
share information and organize meetups and events.

Coeo uses [FOSP](https://github.com/maufl/fosp-specification) to store its data on a server.
Therefore, you need a working FOSP server too, or you use one that is already available.

# Installation

Coeo is a single page javascript application.
You can just clone the repository and serve the directory over a web server.
It should work out of the box.
